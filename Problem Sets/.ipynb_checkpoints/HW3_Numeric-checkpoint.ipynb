    "1. Read in data using Dask\n",
    "2. Descriptive Statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Calculate the Top 10 Exports (in terms of value) of Afghanistan in 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. Calculate the top 10 goods with the highest trade volume in terms of:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        i. Value\n",
    "    \n",
    "        ii. Quantity\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. In the year 2012, who were the top 10 countries with the most trading partners? What about the bottom 10?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    d. Using the designation [here]( https://www.foreign-trade.com/reference/hscode.htm), describe the trade volume in terms of value and list the five highest value sectors in the entire sample period.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. The Gravity Equation Relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Using the country shapefile, calculate the distance in kilometers between all the chosen country centroid and all the other centroids in each row (use haversine distance).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. Using the country we chose in class, create a scatterplot of distance and trade flow volume (quantity and value) in logarithm form. What are the correlations of each plot?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. Interpret the correlations for each of these factors.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Estimation\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a. Create a function called \"SSE_1p\" that subtracts the logarithm of quantity flow from the logarithm of distance times some factor and takes that factor as an input:\n",
    "$$ log(F_{ij}) - \\beta log(d_{ij}) $$\n",
    "    In this case it takes $\\beta$ as an argument.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b. Plot the function from -1 to +3 with steps of .005, and then find the minimum of the function with the numpy function \"argmin.\" Is it what you expected?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c. Create another function called \"SSE_2p\" which takes an array of two elements as an argument and returns the following:\n",
    " $$ log(F_{ij}) - \\beta[0] - \\beta[1] log(d_{ij}) $$\n",
    " \n",
    "     d. Do a grid search with the first parameter range as 1500 to 2500 in steps of 10, and the second parameter range as -1 to +3 in steps of .005 as before. Do it using a for loop which is parallelized using Dask. Comment on how or why the parameter on $log(d_{ij})$ is different than what you found in part 4b.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     e. Now check your results using the \"econtools\" package \"reg\" function by running OLS with a constant term.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     f. Finally, merge in the GDP numbers from the World Bank and do the regression again, except this time the log of each country's GDP as covariates. How did the coefficient on distance change?\n",
    "     \n",
    "5. An analyst asks you \"for which commodity sectors is distance most important in terms of exporting?\" Describe what your economic intuition would say about the answer, and then also map out an analysis strategy for answering their question. As usual, describe:\n",
    "    - What data you would need.\n",
    "    - How you would manipulate the data.\n",
    "    - What analysis you would run.\n"
